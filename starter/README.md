# Coding-Quiz-Challenge
Making a coding quiz using javascript!

## Description

In this weeks challenege, I created coding quiz using mainly javascript. The idea was to get the quiz and the timer to start once the button is pressed and any wrong answer will have a negative effect on the time left. Finally, the the time left over will be the users score.

Only completed a 1/3 of this project and I plan to continue it. So far, the button works where it starts the timer and the questions are displayed, as well as hiding the start screen. Next, I plan to input some questions and figure out a way to calculate the score.

## Installation

No steps required to install project.

## Usage

To start the quiz, user will need to press the 'start quiz' button where they will see the first question displayed and the timer will start to count down.
